# CLDC_Polysemous_Basic_Vocabulary
We present an open-source database of Cross-Linguistic polysemes for basic vocabularies (Cross Linguistic Database of Polysemous Basic Vocabulary) aimed at collecting common concepts and exploring their extended senses as comprehensively as possible. Our database comprises the meanings of 60 basic vocabularies across 12 semantic domains from 61 language varieties spanning 13 language families, totaling 11,841 meanings of 3,736 entries. We delve into some classic concrete concept categories, such as physical entities, human entities, and body parts, as well as characteristic categories like qualities, quantity, and physical attributes, and other common or frequent domains, including motion verbs, pronouns, and numerals. We manually collected data from medium-sized dictionaries. This method enables us to gather intricate and multifaceted meanings while avoiding the need to distinguish between polysemous and homonymous words.
